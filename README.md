### Why Olminu?
The bot is named after Olminu, a character from the manga *Drifters*. As a fan of the character, I chose to name the bot in her honor.

## Inviting Bot
You can add Olminu to your Discord server by following this [link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1303531869878358036) and inviting her.

## Prerequisites
- [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) (version 5.4 or higher)
- [Luvit](https://luvit.io/)
- [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository with the submodules:
    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Alekssandher/Olminu-Bot-Lua.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd olminu-bot
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    lit install SinisterRectus/discordia
    ```

## Setting Up

1. Log in to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers) and create a new application.
> **Note**: Make sure to configure it properly.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root folder.
    - Check the `.env.example` file for the required variables.
3. Replace the placeholder values with your bot's credentials.

> **Note**: For testing, create a dedicated Discord server. Use the `GUILD_ID` environment variable to restrict commands to that server.

## Running the Project

Run the main file using the following command:

```bash
luvit main.lua
```

## Registering Slash Commands
Before registering a command you will need to have at least a command in the ./command/ folder, take a look how one of your commands file should be like:
```lua
  return {
    name = "ping",
    description = "Responde com Pong!",
    execute = function(interaction)
        
        interaction:reply("üèì Pong!", true)
    end
}
```
Registering commands is simple. Use the scripts provided in the repository.
Commands can be registered globally or restricted to a specific guild.

```bash
# To register guild command
luvit scripts/registerGuildCommand.lua <command name in accord to file names in ./commands/>
```
```bash
# To register global command
luvit scripts/registerGlobalCommands.lua <command name in accord to file names in ./commands/>
```
> Note: Global command registration might take up to an hour to propagate across all servers. Guild commands are updated instantly.
## Seeing local/registred commands
To see the commands already registred and the local commands use this script:
```bash
luvit scripts/getApplicationCommands.lua
```
